# Flappy Bird-style Game Design Document


## 1. Game Overview

### 1.1 Concept
This project is a simplified version of the popular Flappy Bird game, implemented in Java using Swing. The player controls a red dot (representing a bird) and navigates it through gaps between green pipes. The game continues until the player collides with a pipe or goes out of bounds.

### 1.2 Genre
2D Side-scrolling Arcade Game

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Casual gamers
- Students learning Java programming
- Anyone interested in simple, addictive games

### 1.4 Game Flow Summary
- The game starts with the bird in the middle of the screen
- Pipes continuously spawn from the right side of the screen and move left
- The player presses the spacebar to make the bird "flap" (jump upwards)
- The bird automatically falls due to gravity
- The player must navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes
- The score increases by 100 points for each set of pipes passed
- The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or goes out of bounds
- The player can restart the game after a game over

## 2. Gameplay and Mechanics

### 2.1 Gameplay
#### 2.1.1 Game Progression
The game has no distinct levels. The difficulty remains constant, but the challenge increases as the player tries to achieve a higher score.

#### 2.1.2 Mission/Challenge Structure
The main challenge is to survive as long as possible while accumulating the highest score.

#### 2.1.3 Objectives
- Navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes
- Avoid colliding with pipes
- Avoid going out of bounds (top or bottom of the screen)
- Achieve the highest score possible

### 2.2 Mechanics
#### 2.2.1 Physics
- The bird falls due to constant gravity
- The bird's upward velocity is set to a fixed value when the player "flaps"
- Pipes move at a constant speed from right to left

#### 2.2.2 Movement
- The bird moves vertically based on gravity and player input
- The bird's horizontal position remains constant
- Pipes move horizontally at a constant speed

#### 2.2.3 Objects
- Bird: Represented by a red dot
- Pipes: Green rectangles with a gap between top and bottom sections

#### 2.2.4 Actions
- Flap: The player presses the spacebar to make the bird jump upwards

#### 2.2.5 Screen Flow
- Main Game Screen: Where the gameplay takes place
- Game Over Screen: Displayed when the player loses, showing the final score and a restart prompt

## 3. Interface

### 3.1 Visual System
- The game uses simple 2D graphics
- The bird is represented by a red dot
- Pipes are green rectangles
- The background is cyan (light blue)
- The score is displayed in the top-left corner

### 3.2 Control System
- Spacebar: Make the bird flap (jump)
- D key: Toggle debug mode

### 3.3 Audio, Music, Sound Effects
(Note: The current implementation does not include audio. This could be a future enhancement.)

### 3.4 Help System
The game relies on intuitive mechanics and does not include a help system. Instructions could be added to the initial screen in future versions.

## 4. Technical

### 4.1 Target Hardware
Any system capable of running Java applications

### 4.2 Development Software
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Any Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code with Java extensions)

### 4.3 Network Requirements
None - This is a standalone application

## 5. Game Art

The game uses simple geometric shapes for visual representation:
- Bird: Red circle
- Pipes: Green rectangles
- Background: Solid cyan color

## 6. Project Scope

### 6.1 Number of Locations
One main game screen

### 6.2 Number of Levels
No distinct levels - continuous gameplay

### 6.3 Number of NPCs
None

### 6.4 Number of Weapons
None

## 7. Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
1. Add sound effects and background music
2. Implement difficulty levels (e.g., adjusting pipe gap size or speed)
3. Add visual enhancements (e.g., sprites for the bird and pipes, scrolling background)
4. Implement a high score system
5. Add power-ups or obstacles
6. Create a mobile version of the game
